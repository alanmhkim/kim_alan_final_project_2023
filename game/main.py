# This file was created by Alan Kim
# Game Name: Snake
# Goal of the game: player starts game off as a snake, and uses arrow keys to collect food.
# When the snake eats food, represented by a yellow circle, it grows longer.
# The game ends if the snake runs into the border or its head comes in direct contact with its body.

"""
Description of code:

Imports: 
1. Screen from turtle - this helps with setting up the screen with dimensions to help the player have an interface to play the actual game on.
2. Snake from Snake - importing the snake class
3. Food from food - importing the food class
4. Scoreboard from scoreboard - importing the scoreboard class
5. Time - allows us to define and represent time in code - determining how fast/slow and when the body of the snake moves throughout the game. In this case, the snake moves 1 block every .1 seconds.

Classes Description:
class Snake - creates the snake composed up of segments. At the start of the game the snake has 3 segments, but as it consumes food it grows one segment. The class also determines its movement and when it touches itself or the wall.
class food - creates the food the snake eats throughout the game. At the start, it randomly spawns somewhere on the screen, and when the snake eats it, it respawns at another random location.
class scoreboard - creates the scoreboard that is displayed at the top of the screen. Throughout the game, the player can view the current and best score to keep track, and the current score updates every time the snake eats food.
