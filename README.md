# Description
This final project is the game of Snake. The snake first spawns in the middle of the screen and starts moving right after the player runs the code, and its body is composed up of 3 segments. The player can control the snake's movement of direction by using the arrow keys. When the snake eats food that spawns randomly in the screen, the snake grows a segment longer. The snake "dies" when the snake hits the edge of the screen, the boundary, or if it touches a part of its body when it is long enough to do so. When the snake "dies," it automatically respawns in the middle of the screen with its original dimensions and the player has to start over. The game is repeating, so the player has to click on the "x" button on the top right of the screen in order to exit the game.
